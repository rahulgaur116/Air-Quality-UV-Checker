## Description & Goal

Our project aims to develop a comprehensive online platform that provides users with real-time information on air quality and UV index levels in their area. By aggregating data from reliable sources and utilizing algorithms, our website offers accurate and up-to-date insights to help users make informed decisions about their outdoor activities and health precautions. Whether it's planning a jog, deciding on outdoor dining, or simply protecting oneself from harmful UV rays, our platform equips users with the knowledge they need to stay safe and healthy. Our ultimate goal is to promote environmental awareness and empower individuals to take proactive steps towards better air quality and sun protection.
