        <h2> Your Health, Your Life.</h2>
        <p>We are your one-stop daily check for environmental factors that cause or contribute to minor or chronic health conditions. Respiratory infections, asthma, and heart disease are a few examples. A simple daily habit on the top of your day can be the marker for a full day of adjusting how much time you spend outside and how the day may impact your skin and respiratory health. For your benefit we have also added a UV level checker so you can control of your skin health. According to the Skin Cancer Foundation the two major causes of skin cancer are the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays and using a UV tanning bed. Being that we cannot control what is occuring with our environmental factors, Prevention is key to not only keep your skin safe from skin cancer, but to ensure it stays healthy throughout your lifetime.   </p>

        <h3>Air Quality</h3>
       <p> Did you know according to the UN environment programme (unep.org) that in 2019, 99% of the world's population was living in places where the WHO's strictest 2021 air quality guideline levels were not met? Every breath we take in particles with potential to ignite damage to our lungs, hearts,and brains. This can lead to dangerous and multiple health problems.  </p>

      <div class="medium-4 columns">
        <h3>What are Ultraviolet (UV) Rays?</h3>
        <p>There are three types of UV radiation from the sun: UVA, UVB, and UVC. All can cause skin and eye damage.</p>
        <p> Use our guide above to find what level of UV radiation it is near you to best coordinate your day. </p>

        <h3>PM25? S02? N02? What does it mean?</h3>
        <p>Fine particulate matter, or <b>PM2.5</b>, is responsible for nearly 4 million deaths globally from cardiopulmonary illnesses such as heart disease, respiratory infections, chronic lung disease, cancers, preterm births, and other illnesses.</p>
        <p><b>Sulfur dioxide (SO2)</b>, are emitted by the burning of fossil fuels or other materials that contain sulfur.</p>
          Road traffic is the principal outdoor source of <b>N02</b>,nitrogen dioxide.</p>

      <div class="row">
      <div class="medium-4 columns">
        <h3> Air Pollutants & Environment</h3>
        <p>Air pollution particles eventually fall back to Earth. Air pollution can directly contaminate the surface of bodies of water and soil. This can kill crops or reduce their yield. It can kill young trees and other plants.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="medium-4 columns">
        <h3> Why Cloud Cover is Important</h3>
        <p>Clouds can scatter and reflect UV radiation, which means UV radiation level can be high even on a cloudy day. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="medium-4 columns">
        <h3> Time of Day & Season </h3>
        <p>UV radiation level is higher between 10am and 4pm. The summer has the highest radiation levels of all the seasons. The closer to the equator, the higher the UV radiation levels.Other Environmental conditions to consider are surfaces like water, sand, snow, and pavement scatter and reflect UV radiation, leading to an increase in radiation level.</p>

        <p> UV and Sun Protection: Proper protection such as wearing SPF 50+ hats and clothing. 50+ Sunscreen every day especially on ears and neck area. Additional environmental factors to consider are blue light from devices and even if you are indoors you can still recieve UV damage from light through windows.
